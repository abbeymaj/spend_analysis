**Description of the Project**

This project was built to help me track my spending on a monthly basis. The data was pulled using Python and a feature store was created to analyze the data. The feature store was created in a Jupyter Notebook and stored in a CSV file since Tableau Public does not have an option to upload a SQL View.
